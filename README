The iCal NaturalEventAdder
by Jeff Cleary


INTRODUCTION
------------
  Adding a new event in iCal is painful.  The NaturalEventAdder makes it
  easy to add events and make use of a calendar's ability to help you keep
  track of your life.  This works by parsing a text input description of the 
  new event and creating a new event directly in iCal.
  
  No need to reach for that mouse - just type a natural description of the
  thing you want to remember and get on with your life.


USAGE INSTRUCTIONS
------------------
  The NaturalEventAdder works in two modes:
  
  1) Command line: $ ./iCalNaturalEventAdder.py "Board meeting May 29th 4:30pm"
  2) Graphical:  $ ./iCalNaturalEventAdder.py
    ** Bonus Recommended Usage: Hook this up to a keyboard shortcut using 
       Quicksilver or Spark and never leave the keyboard.
  
  Event string examples:
    "Pick up dry cleaning tomorrow"
    "Taxes deadline 4/14/2010 alert 1 day before"
    "Har Mar Superstar concert friday 9pm"
    "Hyperproductive conference call thursday 4pm alert 1 hour before"
    "Return unwanted presents December 26th"
    Use the 'in' modifier to attach to a particular calendar:
      "dinner with friends saturday in Social"

FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS OF THE FUTURE
---------------------------------

  Size - 40MB compiled is way too big, but this comes from bundling in 
  wxPython, appscript, etc.
  More parsing - This version handles a basic set of expected event strings, 
  but there are many more possibilities.
  Confirmation Dialog - pretty this business up
  Run in background - Instead of attaching this to a Quicksilver or Spark 
  hotkey, would be nice to have it run in background.
